## Overview

Built as a gift for my mother, PuppyPanel is a Raspberry Pi-powered kiosk that tracks when our corgi, Markie, was last fed, taken out, or given his pill.
The main dashboard contains three buttons, one to press for each corresponding action. The time and date are recorded on the webpage, and are saved in
an SQLlite database. There is also an undo button for each action, in case of misclicks.
